This code accompanies the manuscript: "Burnt bridge ratchet motor force scales linearly with polyvalency: a computational study" By Aaron T. Blanchard (Soft Matter, 2021, DOI: 10.1039/D1SM00676B)

Note that these functions were not professionally written and may contain bugs, inefficiencies, and confusing sections. These function were not written with other end-users in mind. They are also uncommented. Please use at your own risk. Contact Aaron Blanchard at ATBlanchard@ymail.com if you have questions. Here is a list of descriptions of the files included:

MarkovChainNoForceOptimizeKon.m – Used to calculate data for Figure 2b and optimize kon values.
WLCapprox.m – Contains code for performing Petrosyan approximation of WLC force-extension curves. Used in EnergyExtensionCalc.m.
EnergyExtensionCalc.m – Calculates the energy-extension curves for tethers and the association transition state.
FEX15bpAndTethTst.mat – Contains energy-extension calculations, generated using EnergyExtensionCalc.m, used in subsequent functions.
konAndKoffVsForcePlot.m – Used to calculate data for Figure 3 c-e. Try decreasing Npts to make the code run faster. PDF variables were used to calculate PDFs shown in Figure 3b. 
“Fixed Force Dependent On Rate Output.mat” contains calculations for Markov Chain calculations (needed for MarkovChainWithFoce.m) and was generated using konAndKoffVsForcePlot.m.
MarkovChainWithForce.m – Used to calculate data for Figure 3f,g and estimate polyvalency scaling
“F50 vs Force 1 second output.mat” and “F50 vs Force 1 minute output.mat” are used in PostProcessF50vN.m for display purposes and were generated with MarkovChainWithForce.m. (Note F50 is equivalent to Fstall).
PostProcessF50vN.m – Used to generate final figures for Figure 3g.
